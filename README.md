This application demonstrates the implementation details of a
convolutional network (CNN) programmed with Python class structures.

The application includes training, testing, and tuning tasks for
fitting the network model. Matplotlib makes plots of accuracy, loss,
the confusion matrix, and sample dataset images. Gridsearchcv allows
optimizaton across a combination of hyper-parameters. Long running
tasks are delegated to threads, with feedback to update progess bars.
