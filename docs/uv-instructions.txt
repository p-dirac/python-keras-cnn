For project description, read Python-Keras-CNN.pdf in docs folder, and 
download the datasets.
Follow these instructions for cloning a git repository that was built 
using the Astral uv Python package manager.

1. Open windows command prompt, and go to directory to install the clone
(referred to as 'convonet' in the documentation)
cd <clone path>

2. Install uv, and add uv path in windows system environment:
pip install uv

3. Clone the desired repository:
git clone https://github.com/p-dirac/python-keras-cnn

4. Change directory to cloned project:
cd <cloned path>

5. Create new virtual environment(.venv) for the cloned project 
based on pyproject.toml and uv.lock files. All dependencies will
be installed:
uv sync

6. To download image CNN datasets, see Python-Keras-CNN.pdf in 
the docs folder.

7. Activate the virtual environment:
call .venv\Scripts\activate

8. Run the application with Python, from convonet directory
(may take a couple minutes to open):
python src/cnnpy/app.py

9. To create a windows exe file in the dist directory,
run the batch file:
uv-py-to-exe.bat

10. To run the windows exe file, from convonet directory
"dist/app.exe"
